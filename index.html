    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  As a Techie, I am an aspiring web developer passionate about Technology, Design, and Digital solutions. I studied Information Communication Technology (ICT) at one of the institutes here in Kenya, where I was first introduced to the world of tech.
</p>

<p>
  After college, I decided to continue my learning journey through self-teaching and hands-on practice. That’s how <strong>SynthCode</strong> was born — a personal brand and space to showcase my growth as I dive deeper into web development.
</p>

<p>
  I believe in continuous learning, and every project I create is a step toward becoming a skilled full-stack developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
